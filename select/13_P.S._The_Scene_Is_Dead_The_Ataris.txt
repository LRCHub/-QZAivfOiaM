Do you know what its like,
To live somewhere that sucks,
And everyone tries to bring you down?
No place for you to go,
And see a punk rock show.
You spend your whole life trying to get out.

Not gonna live in a small town
Not gonna die in a small town
Everywhere's a fucking small town
Get out while you're young!
